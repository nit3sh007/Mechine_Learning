95% CI 1·1–1·3)137 and clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (1·6, 1·3–1·9) compared with no sleep disturbance, although not all cohort studies excluded those with cognitive impairment or dementia at baseline from their analyses.138 A U-shaped association has been reported between sleep duration and risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia with higher risks of dementia with less than 5 hours (HR=2·6; 95% CI 1·4–5·1) compared with more than 5 and less than 7 and more than 10 hours sleep (2·2, 1·4–3·5) and risks for all-cause dementia and clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease being similar.135, 139, 140, 141<br/><br/>In a pooled metaanalysis from over 2·3 million individuals with type 2 diabetes across 14 cohort studies, including 102 174 with dementia, diabetes was associated with an increased risk of any dementia (RR 1·6, 95% CI 1·5-1·8 for women and 1·6, 1·4-1·8 for men).<br/><br/>282 People with delirium without known dementia are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia in the future than others, either because of pre-existing undiagnosed dementia or cognitive impairment, present in 20·7% (95% CI 11·9-29·5) and 37·8% (27·3-88·3) respectively of one cohort, or because delirium has neurotoxic effects and so precipitates dementia.<br/><br/>268 People with dementia experience longer and more frequent admissions and readmissions; health-care expenditure for people with moderate-severe dementia is around double that of people without dementia.<br/><br/>91 Notably, however, no difference in dementia risk measured 10-15 years before time of dementia incidence was found except in those with comorbid cardio-metabolic disease (RR 1·3, 95% CI 0·8-2·1).<br/><br/>A systematic review and meta-analysis including 34 studies of 277 432 people with dementia found that in the six studies which compared the two groups, people with dementia had increased hospital admissions compared with those without dementia, after adjusting for age, sex, and physical comorbidity (RR 1·4, 95% CI 1·2–1·7; figure 9 ).271 Hospitalisation rates in people with dementia ranged from 0·37 to 1·26 per person-year in high-quality studies.<br/><br/>266, A systematic review and meta-analysis including 34 studies of 277 432 people with dementia found that in the six studies which compared the two groups, people with dementia had increased hospital admissions compared with those without dementia, after adjusting for age, sex, and physical comorbidity (RR 1·4, 95% CI 1·2-1·7; figure 9 ).<br/><br/>Delirium is common in people with dementia and contributes to cognitive decline.<br/><br/>All these disturbances were associated with a higher risk of all-cause dementia (RR 1·2; 95% CI 1·1-1·3) 137 and clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (1·6, 1·3-1·9) compared with no sleep disturbance, although not all cohort studies excluded those with cognitive impairment or dementia at baseline from their analyses.<br/><br/>212 The mean mini mental state examination (MMSE) was 23, only 38% had a formal diagnosis of dementia; the majority of participants (51%) had mild dementia but some had moderate and some severe dementia.<br/><br/>A French 5-year longitudinal study of over 31 million people admitted to hospital, found alcohol use disorders (harmful use or dependence as defined in ICD) were associated with increased dementia risk, calculated separately for men and women (women HR 3·3, 95% CI 3·3–3·4, men 3·4, 3·3–3·4).103 The relationship of dementia with alcohol use disorders was particularly clear in the earlier onset dementias (age less than 65 years) in which 56·6% had an alcohol use disorder noted in their records (n=57 353; 5·2% all dementias).<br/><br/>Depression might be a risk for dementia, but in later life dementia might cause depression.<br/><br/>In one hospital inpatients' survey nearly 35% of those older than 80 years experienced delirium; those with prior cognitive impairment had 15 times the risk of developing delirium than those without (OR 15·3, 95% CI 5·2–45·4).282 People with delirium without known dementia are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia in the future than others, either because of pre-existing undiagnosed dementia or cognitive impairment, present in 20·7% (95% CI 11·9–29·5) and 37·8% (27·3–88·3) respectively of one cohort, or because delirium has neurotoxic effects and so precipitates dementia.283 People with similar neuropathology show faster cognitive decline if they develop delirium than if they do not.284 Additionally, older people without dementia declined cognitively more than twice as fast after an emergency hospital admission for any cause, compared with those not admitted, suggesting any severe illness is associated with cognitive decline.285 Risk factors for delirium in dementia include sensory impairment, pain, polypharmacy, dehydration, intercurrent illnesses, such as urinary tract infections or faecal impaction, and an unfamiliar or changing environment.286 Delirium in older people should prompt consideration of underlying dementia.<br/><br/>Health-care professionals should consider dementia in older people without known dementia who have frequent admissions or who develop delirium.<br/><br/>Pre-specified secondary outcomes were also reduced in the intensive arm for mild cognitive impairment (14·6 vs 18·3 cases/1000 person-years; HR 0·8, 95% CI 0·7–1·0), combined mild cognitive impairment or dementia (20·2 vs 24·1 cases/1000 person-years; HR 0·9, 95% CI 0·7–1·0)79 making this the first trial to suggest reduction of risk for mild cognitive impairment.<br/><br/>Admissions are often for conditions that might be manageable in the community (potentially preventable hospitalisations).268 People with dementia experience longer and more frequent admissions and readmissions; health-care expenditure for people with moderate-severe dementia is around double that of people without dementia.269, 272, 273 Early detection and management of physical ill-health in people with dementia, particularly of pain, falls, diabetes, incontinence, and sensory impairment, is important.199, 274, 275 However, no intervention has successfully reduced number of hospital admissions of community-dwelling people with dementia,276 although education, exercise, rehabilitation, and telemedicine have reduced admissions for older people without dementia.277<br/><br/>245 Multimorbidity in people with dementia is associated with faster functional decline 248 and worse quality of life for people with dementia and their family carers.|2020-08-03|\n",
